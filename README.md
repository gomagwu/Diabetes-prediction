# Diabetes-prediction

I tried to predict the diabetic status of women based on a series of factors provided in the 'Diabetes.csv' file.
The factors included things i didn't know contributed to the ailment, been thinking all you had to do was avoid sugar,sheesh.

The file had data of various forms and unlike most of the work i had done, required 'feature scaling'. 
Shoutout Andrewyng. I imported the Standard scaler for this purpose.

I applied Support Vector Classification on the data and got the following results:
Training data accuracy of 78.7%, 
Test data accuracy of 77.3%
